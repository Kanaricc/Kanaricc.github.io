# [CF EDU72D] Coloring Edges

You are given a directed graph with n vertices and m directed edges without self-loops or multiple edges.

Let's denote the k-coloring of a digraph as following: you color each edge in one of k colors. The k-coloring is good if and only if there no cycle formed by edges of same color.

Find a good k-coloring of given digraph with minimum possible k.
